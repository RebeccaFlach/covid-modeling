#### Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?

My understanding is the team is replicating an experiment that evaluates differernt malware mitigation tactics through movement patterns and security interventions. It answers the question "What is the best method to prevent/mitigate the spread of malware?". I'd say the explanation was clear and digestible for readers outside of the class setting to understand. 

#### Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?

I undertood the walking patterns and the vsiuals, but I didn't see much of a connection between the two. Like, how did the authors get from those movement patterns to graphs that display the number of infected squads over time? Outside of that, it makes sense for the question.

#### Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?

The results are easy to understand and clear. The visuals are effective in conveying information and have all the labels needed for a clean graph.

#### Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?

The interpretation seems to answer the motivating question and looks into why the results turned out the way they did. Their argument seems logical.

#### Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the authors demonstrate that consistency?  Is it quantitative or qualitative?

The shape is a little off, but the general trends in the original graph visuals still hold in the replication graph visuals. 

#### Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Can it answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?

The extension is explained clearly and also answers an intersting question that wasn't addressed in the original paper. I look forward to the results.

#### Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?

This team seems to be in good shape!

#### Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guideLinks to an external site.?

It looks good to me!

#### Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style? 

All correct.
