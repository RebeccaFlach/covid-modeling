# COVID-19 Modeling in Supermarkets

By: Rebecca Flach and Daniel Quinteros

## Abstract
In this paper, we use agent based models to investigate risk factors for COVID transmission in supermarkets and similar environments.

In this paper, the authors investigate how COVID is transmitted within a supermarket, and use their model to determine the most effective interventions to decrease spread. In their primary experiment, they model a small supermarket using a graph, where each node is a place where a customer would stop and interact with the shelves, register, or other important point. They then create agents to represent customers, each with a random path through the store and time spent at each location. Infection risk is estimated by the amount of time a susceptible agent spends in proximity to an infected agent. They find that transmission risk is increased by bottleneck points, like the registers, and that limiting the number of customers in the store is an effective way to reduce transmission.

## Methodology


4) A description of the experiment from these papers that you are replicating and the extensions or variations of those experiments you are working on.

## Results

5) Results from the replication and possibly preliminary results from the extension. Or if you don't have results, sketch what the results from these experiments might look like, possibly using a cartoon of a graphical result.

6) Interpret the results; for example, "If the power spectrum on a log-log scale is approximately linear, we will estimate its slope.  If that slope is near 1, we will conclude that the time series generated by the model resembles pink noise."

## Causes for concern

7) Identify causes for concern.  Review the criteria for what makes a good project and identify any areas where your project might be problematic.


## Next steps
8) Outline next steps.  For each team member, what do you plan to work on immediately?  For the team, what do you think you can get done in the next week?  Consider using GitHub Projects to make a kanban board to track tasks.
