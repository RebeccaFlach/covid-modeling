Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?
The question is how does malware spread between groups moving in different movement patterns.
The explanation is good!

Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?
I'm slighly confused about the method of malware spread. Is it when squads are in the same location? Within a certain distance? 
Also, how are the waypoints and starting locations chosen? Is there a limited size area?

Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?
What's the difference between graphs (a) and (b)?
For replication, it might be good to convert ticks to hours if you can. 

Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?
The interpretation is pretty short, but it does answer the question. Is there some way you could talk about broader implications of this finding?

Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the authors demonstrate that consistency?  Is it quantitative or qualitative?
The general result is consistent! The shapes and the overall difference is similar. 

Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Can it answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?
Yes, cool extension! 

Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?
Definitely seems on track!

Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guideLinks to an external site.?
Looks good. 

Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style?
Yes!
